# mcc1134r-mod5-react-routing

## Copy the 'Material-UI' Application from Module 4.  I have included a sample under 1-InClass in Module 5.

### Modify the application as follows:

1. Add routing per the documentation.
1. Add the following routes:
    1.  /Home
        1.  Should add a introduction to your page. Should show links to Listing and 
    1. /Listing

        1.  Listing should show the listing of cards

    1. /Detail

        1. Detail should show a dynamic route

    1. /Contact

        1. Should show your contact information. (Use your name but you can use fictional data if you'd like).

    1. Add a NotFound Route (404)

    1. Add a Redirect    

### Note: if you would like to reuse a previous example of your code, don't forget to run 'npm install' after you have copied your code into your directory.  The 'node_modules' folder is ignored whenn saving to 'git' so this reinitializes your modules.
